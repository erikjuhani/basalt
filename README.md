<h3>Basalt&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>TUI Application to manage Obsidian notes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

TUI Application to manage Obsidian vaults and notes directly from the terminal ✨.

![Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erikjuhani/basalt/refs/heads/main/assets/basalt_demo.gif)
## Installation

Install basalt using cargo:

```sh
cargo install basalt-tui
```

Or use the precompiled binaries from the latest basalt release.
## Background

This is something that has been brewing in my head for quite some time. There has been different incarnations over the years, however, nothing as substantial as this.

I have been using Neovim and the official Obsidian app. However, I wanted to have something dedicated that offers the same writing experience as Neovim, but has more WYSIWYG experience as in the official Obsidian app. I'm fully aware of [obsidian.nvim](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim), which many people use and find more than sufficient. However, I want to see images, beautified text, note graphs, etc. I want it to be a bit more.

The problem for me personally is that when I leave the terminal, my flow breaks, especially if I'm writing. Using an entirely different app disrupts that flow, and it _annoys_ me. So here I am, building a TUI for Obsidian.

The goal of basalt is not to replace the Obsidian app. Basalt is to fill and cater for a need to have a terminal view to the selection of notes and vaults, providing quick access from anywhere in the terminal with a simple command.

## Configuration

Basalt keybindings can be changed or additional keybindings can be added by providing a configuration file. Directly under `$HOME/.basalt.toml` or `.config/basalt/config.toml`.

Each keybinding is attached to a 'pane' and can be used when the pane is active. Global section affects all panes and is evaluated first.

The configuration used for default key bindings:

```toml
[global]
key_bindings = [
 { key = "q", command = "quit" },
 { key = "ctrl+g", command = "vault_selector_modal_toggle" },
 { key = "?", command = "help_modal_toggle" },
]

[splash]
key_bindings = [
 { key = "k", command = "splash_up" },
 { key = "j", command = "splash_down" },
 { key = "up", command = "splash_up" },
 { key = "down", command = "splash_down" },
 { key = "enter", command = "splash_open" },
]

[explorer]
key_bindings = [
 { key = "k", command = "explorer_up" },
 { key = "j", command = "explorer_down" },
 { key = "up", command = "explorer_up" },
 { key = "down", command = "explorer_down" },
 { key = "t", command = "explorer_toggle" },
 { key = "s", command = "explorer_sort" },
 { key = "tab", command = "explorer_switch_pane" },
 { key = "enter", command = "explorer_open" },
 { key = "ctrl+b", command = "explorer_toggle" },
 { key = "ctrl+u", command = "explorer_scroll_up_half_page" },
 { key = "ctrl+d", command = "explorer_scroll_down_half_page" },
]

[note_viewer]
key_bindings = [
 { key = "k", command = "note_viewer_scroll_up_one" },
 { key = "j", command = "note_viewer_scroll_down_one" },
 { key = "up", command = "note_viewer_scroll_up_one" },
 { key = "down", command = "note_viewer_scroll_down_one" },
 { key = "t", command = "note_viewer_toggle_explorer" },
 { key = "tab", command = "note_viewer_switch_pane" },
 { key = "ctrl+b", command = "note_viewer_toggle_explorer" },
 { key = "ctrl+u", command = "note_viewer_scroll_up_half_page" },
 { key = "ctrl+d", command = "note_viewer_scroll_down_half_page" },
]

[help_modal]
key_bindings = [
 { key = "esc", command = "help_modal_close" },
 { key = "k", command = "help_modal_scroll_up_one" },
 { key = "j", command = "help_modal_scroll_down_one" },
 { key = "up", command = "help_modal_scroll_up_one" },
 { key = "down", command = "help_modal_scroll_down_one" },
 { key = "ctrl+u", command = "help_modal_scroll_up_half_page" },
 { key = "ctrl+d", command = "help_modal_scroll_down_half_page" },
]

[vault_selector_modal]
key_bindings = [
 { key = "k", command = "vault_selector_modal_up" },
 { key = "j", command = "vault_selector_modal_down" },
 { key = "up", command = "vault_selector_modal_up" },
 { key = "down", command = "vault_selector_modal_down" },
 { key = "enter", command = "vault_selector_modal_open" },
 { key = "esc", command = "vault_selector_modal_close" },
]
```

## Default key bindings

These key bindings can be overwritten or more can be added with user configuration.

<kbd>q</kbd> Quit the application

<kbd>?</kbd> Show help

<kbd>t</kbd> Toggle side panel visibility and select mode

<kbd>k</kbd> Move selection up

<kbd>j</kbd> Move selection down

<kbd>↑ / ↓</kbd> Scroll selected up / down

<kbd>↩ Enter</kbd> Select the highlighted note

<kbd>Ctrl-g</kbd> Toggle vault selector modal

<kbd>Ctrl-u</kbd> Scroll up half a page

<kbd>Ctrl-d</kbd> Scroll down half a page

## Contribution Policy (I want to help)

Basalt is open for code contributions, but mainly for bug fixes. Feature work can bring long-term maintenance overhead, and I'd like to keep that to a minimum. One big reason for limiting feature work is that I want to build the features myself as this is my _FUN_ project alongside work, and I want to keep it that way.

However, I do realize that open source projects usually flourish from multiple contributors, thus, I won't say no, if you would like to contribute on feature work, but please, open an issue first, so we can chat about it. That way we can avoid unnecessary effort or bike shedding over architectural or stylistic choices. I have my own opinions and ideas on how certain things should be written in this project.

I want this project to feel low-barrier so don't be discouraged to open an issue, be it about existing features, ideas, or anything really!

Furthermore, I will make a proper contribution's guideline a bit later, with more details on certain operational things of this project.

If you find mistakes in the documentation or simple fixes in code please go ahead and open a pull request with the changes!

### Contributing

1. Make a fork from `basalt`
2. Create a branch
3. Open a pull-request against basalt's main branch with your changes
4. I'll review your pull-request as soon as possible and either leave comments or merge it

#### I Found a Bug

Know how to fix it? - Open a PR with the fix.

Not sure or you don't want to do it yourself? - Open an issue with steps to reproduce.

#### I Found a Typo

Open a PR directly with the correction.

#### I Want To Contribute on a Feature

Open an issue first, so we can chat about the feature work!

### Git Pre-push Hook

There's a useful pre-push git-hook under `scripts`, which you can enable by running the following command:

```
cp scripts/pre-push .git/hooks/
```

The script runs the same test commands as in the `test.yml` workflow.
