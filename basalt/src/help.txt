                 vaults and notes directly from the terminal.

DISCLAIMER

  Basalt is in its early stages, with a very limited set of features, and is
  therefore susceptible to changes. Currently, the major drawback of Basalt is
  the inability to modify any notes. Another limitation is the missing or
  incomplete rendering of certain markdown styles. However, these features will
  be prioritized in the next version.

  Quitting the application may feel a bit abrupt, as the application exits
  immediately after pressing ‹q›. I have some plans to handle this differently
  in the future. For example, through a series of button presses or by using
  command inputs similar to Vims ‹:quit› or ‹:q›.

VAULT SELECTION

  On startup screen you can select the Vault you want to view. Any vaults
  considered open are shown with a ◆ symbol marker.

      ‹q›         Quit the application
      ‹?›         Show this help
      ‹k›         Move selection up
      ‹j›         Move selection down
      ‹↩ Enter›   Select and open the highlighted vault

  The vault selection can be brought up as a modal by hitting ‹Space› after
  startup screen.

MODES

  The current mode is displayed in the bottom-left corner of the UI.

  The distinction between the SELECT and NORMAL modes is that in SELECT mode,
  you can browse and preview the notes in the vault, and in NORMAL mode, you
  can navigate the content of a single selected note. Scrolling the notes work
  in both modes.

  SELECT
          Navigate the vault's notes.

          In SELECT mode, the vault contents can be selected by pressing Enter
          or Return key. The list can be traversed up or down using ‹j› for
          down and ‹k› for up. To change to NORMAL mode and hide the side
          panel, press ‹t›.

            ‹q›         Quit the application
            ‹?›         Show this help
            ‹t›         Toggle side panel visibility and select mode
            ‹k›         Move selection up
            ‹j›         Move selection down
            ‹s›         Toggle note sorting
            ‹↑ / ↓›     Scroll selected note content up / down
            ‹↩ Enter›   Select the highlighted note

            ‹Space›     Toggle vault selector modal
            ‹Ctrl-u›    Scroll selected note up half a page
            ‹Ctrl-d›    Scroll selected note down half a page

  NORMAL
          Navigate the note.

          In NORMAL mode, the contents of the note can be viewed and navigated.
          Use mouse or arrow keys ‹↑ / ↓› to scroll up / down the note. To
          toggle the SELECT mode and show side panel, press ‹t›.

            ‹q›         Quit the application
            ‹?›         Show this help
            ‹t›         Toggle side panel visibility and select mode
            ‹k›         Move selection up
            ‹j›         Move selection down
            ‹↑ / ↓›     Scroll selected note content up / down
            ‹↩ Enter›   Select the highlighted note

            ‹Space›     Toggle vault selector modal
            ‹Ctrl-u›    Scroll selected note up half a page
