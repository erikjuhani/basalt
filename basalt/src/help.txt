                      TUI Application to manage Obsidian
                 vaults and notes directly from the terminal.

DISCLAIMER

  Basalt is in its early stages, with a very limited set of features, and is
  therefore susceptible to changes. The experimental editor feature is disabled
  by default but can be enabled in the configuration file. When enabled, it
  allows basic note modification and editing capabilities.

  Quitting the application may feel a bit abrupt, as the application exits
  immediately after pressing ‹q›. I have some plans to handle this differently
  in the future. For example, through a series of button presses or by using
  command inputs similar to Vim's ‹:quit› or ‹:q›.

VAULT SELECTION

  On startup screen you can select the Vault you want to view. Any open vaults
  are shown with a ◆ symbol marker.

  DEFAULT KEY BINDINGS

    ‹q›,        Quit the application
    ‹Ctrl+C›
    ‹?›         Show this help
    ‹k›         Move selection up
    ‹j›         Move selection down
    ‹↩ Enter›   Select and open the highlighted vault

    ‹Tab›       Switch to next pane
    ‹Shift+Tab› Switch to previous pane

  The vault selection can be brought up as a modal by hitting ‹Ctrl+G› after
  the startup screen.

INTERFACE

  The application has two main panes: the Explorer (file browser) on the left
  and the Note Editor on the right. You can switch between these panes using
  the Tab key. The currently active pane will be highlighted and name of the
  active pane is displayed in the lower left corner of the application.

  EXPLORER PANE

    Browse and select notes from your vault.

    The explorer shows all notes and folders in your vault. You can navigate up
    and down through the list, and press Enter to select and view a note. The
    explorer panel can be toggled on/off to give more space to the note editor.

    Explorer panel can be expanded and hidden. The Explorer panel has a ⟹
    symbol indicator when it is expanded.

    DEFAULT KEY BINDINGS

      ‹q›,        Quit the application
      ‹Ctrl+C›
      ‹?›         Show this help

      ‹→ / l›     Expand explorer panel
      ‹↩ Enter›   Select and view the highlighted note

      ‹Tab›       Switch to next pane
      ‹Shift+Tab› Switch to previous pane

  OUTLINE PANE

    Browse and go to heading in a note.

    The outline shows all headings in the note. You can navigate up and down
    through the list, and press ‹Enter› to expand or collapse a heading. To
    move the cursor to the heading in the document press ‹g›. The outline pane
    can be toggled on/off to give more space to the note editor.

    DEFAULT KEY BINDINGS

      ‹q›,        Quit the application
      ‹Ctrl+C›

      ‹?›         Show this help

  NOTE EDITOR PANE

    Read and navigate through your selected note. The note editor supports
    multiple modes when experimental editor is enabled.

    VIEW MODE (Default)

      View mode displays the rendered markdown content with navigation support.
      This is the default display mode for reading notes.

CONFIGURATION

  Basalt key mappings can be modified or extended by defining key mappings in
  the user configuration file. Each key mapping is associated with a specific
  'pane' and becomes active when that pane has focus. The global section

  The experimental editor feature is disabled by default. To enable editor
  functionality, set `experimental_editor = true` in your configuration file.
