Basalt is always booted up in the 'splash' screen, where users can pick a vault from a list of available vaults to be opened.

## Panes

Basalt user interface is divided into different panes; modals and components.

### Explorer (Sidebar)

Explorer is shown on the left side and displays the folders and notes under the selected vault.

In the future explorer will support creating folders, notes and renaming or moving them.

### Note editor

Note editor is the 'main' pane that is used to view and modify the selected note.

## Components

### Status bar

The status bar shows bits of helpful information at the bottom of the screen, which includes the currently selected pane; and amount of words and characters.

## Modals

Modals are UI components that can be opened on top of existing active panes or other components.

### Help Modal

Help modal can be accessed by pressing <kbd>?</kbd>. Help modal contains the essential information of each pane and key mappings.

### Vault Selector Modal

Vault selector modal can be accessed by pressing <kbd>Ctrl+g</kbd>, which lets you select another vault from the list of available vaults.
