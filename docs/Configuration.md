[[Basalt]] features and functionality can be customized using a user-defined configuration file. The configuration file should be located in one of the following directories:

**macOS and Unix:**

- `$HOME/.basalt.toml`
- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/basalt/config.toml`

**Windows:**

- `%USERPROFILE%\.basalt.toml`
- `%APPDATA%\basalt\config.toml`

If configuration files exist in multiple locations, only the first one found will be used, with the home directory configuration taking precedence. 

> [!WARNING]
>
> This behavior may change in future versions to merge all found configurations instead.

## Key Mappings

Basalt key mappings can be modified or extended by defining key mappings in the user configuration file.

Each key mapping is associated with a specific 'pane' and becomes active when that pane has focus. The global section applies to all panes and is evaluated first.

Key bindings support both built-in Basalt commands and custom arbitrary command execution, allowing you to integrate external applications and create automation workflows.

## Custom Command Execution

In addition to built-in commands, you can execute arbitrary external commands using special command prefixes:

```toml
[global]
key_bindings = [
  { key = "q", command = "quit" },  # Built-in command
  { key = "ctrl+alt+e", command = "spawn:open obsidian://daily?vault=%vault" },  # Custom spawn command
  { key = "ctrl+g", command = "exec:nvim %note" },  # Custom exec command
]
```

### Command Types

#### Built-in Commands

These are Basalt's native commands that control application behavior (see full list in the Default Configuration section below).

#### Execute Command - `exec:`

Runs a command in the current shell environment. The command will block until completion. Only the first argument is treated as the executable command, with all remaining arguments passed as literal parameters.

```toml
key_bindings = [
  { key = "ctrl+alt+e", command = "exec:nvim %note_path" },
]
```

#### Spawn Process - `spawn:`

Spawns a new process without blocking. This is for opening external applications or URLs. Like `exec:`, only the first argument is the executable, with remaining arguments passed as literal parameters.

```toml
key_bindings = [
  { key = "ctrl+o", command = "spawn:open %note" },
  { key = "ctrl+b", command = "spawn:open https://example.com" },
]
```

## Variables

Basalt provides special variables that are dynamically replaced with current context information:

| Variable | Description | Example Value |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| `%vault` | Current vault name | `my-notes` |
| `%note` | Current note name | `My Note` |
| `%note_path` | Current note file path | `/path/to/vault/daily/2024-01-15.md` |

Variables can be used anywhere within the command string and will be replaced at runtime.

## Integration Examples

### Obsidian Integration

Obsidian supports URL schemes that start with `obsidian://`, allowing you to trigger various actions within the application:

```toml
# Open daily note in Obsidian
key_bindings = [
  { key = "ctrl+d", command = "spawn:open obsidian://daily?vault=%vault" },
]

# Open specific note in Obsidian
key_bindings = [
  { key = "ctrl+alt+e", command = "spawn:open obsidian://open?vault=%vault&file=%note" },
]

# Create new note in Obsidian
key_bindings = [
  { key = "ctrl+n", command = "spawn:open obsidian://new?vault=%vault&name=New Note" },
]

# Open specific path in Obsidian
key_bindings = [
  { key = "ctrl+p", command = "spawn:open obsidian://open?path=%note_path" },
]
```

Common Obsidian URI actions include:
- `obsidian://open` - Open a specific note
- `obsidian://new` - Create a new note
- `obsidian://daily` - Open daily note
- `obsidian://search` - Perform a search

For more information about Obsidian URI schemes, see the [official Obsidian URI documentation](https://help.obsidian.md/Extending+Obsidian/Obsidian+URI).

### External Editor Integration

```toml
# Open current note in VS Code
key_bindings = [
  { key = "ctrl+c", command = "spawn:code %note" },
]

# Open current note in vim
key_bindings = [
  { key = "ctrl+v", command = "exec:vim %note" },
]

# Open current note in nano
key_bindings = [
  { key = "ctrl+n", command = "exec:nano %note" },
]
```

### Web Integration

```toml
# Open specific URLs
key_bindings = [
  { key = "ctrl+g", command = "spawn:open https://github.com/user/repo" },
]

# Search engines - construct URLs with variables
key_bindings = [
  { key = "ctrl+s", command = "spawn:open https://www.google.com/search?q=%note" },
]
```

## Platform Considerations

- **macOS**: Use `cmd` instead of `ctrl` for standard shortcuts, and `open` command for launching applications
- **Linux**: Use `xdg-open` for opening files/URLs with default applications
- **Windows**: Use `start` command for opening files/URLs

## Tips

1. **Use `spawn:` for non-blocking operations** like opening applications or URLs
2. **Use `exec:` for quick commands** that should complete before continuing
3. **Test your key bindings** to ensure they don't conflict with existing Basalt shortcuts
4. **Command limitations** - only the first argument is the executable, no shell expansion or piping
5. **Use full paths** if executables aren't in your PATH
6. **Variables work in arguments** - `%vault`, `%note` and `%note_path` are expanded in argument positions

## Troubleshooting

- If a key binding doesn't work, check that the key combination isn't already used by Basalt or your system
- Ensure external commands are available in your PATH
- Use absolute paths for commands if they're not found
- Check that variables like `%vault`, `%note` and `%note_path` are being populated correctly in your context
- Shell features like pipes (`|`), redirects (`>`), and command substitution (`$(...)`) are not supported
- Complex operations requiring shell features should be wrapped in scripts that can be called as single commands
