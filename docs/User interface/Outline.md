The Outline is the pane on the right side, listing headings from the current note. Use it to get an overview of the note structure and jump to specific sections.

Use `j`/`k` or arrow keys to move through the headings. Press `Enter` to expand or collapse a heading, and `g` to jump to that heading in the [[Note editor]].
