The Explorer is the sidebar pane on the left side, displaying folders and notes in the current vault.

Use `j`/`k` or arrow keys to move through the file list and `Enter` to open a note in the [[Note editor]]. You can sort the list with `s`, resize the pane with `h`/`l`, and rename notes or directories with `r` (press `i` in the rename dialog to start typing).
