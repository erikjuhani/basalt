[[Basalt]] is ***open for code contributions***, but _primarily_ for bug fixes. Why? Feature work can bring long-term maintenance overhead, and I'd like to keep that to a minimum. One big reason for limiting feature work is that I want to build features myself, as this is a _fun_ side project alongside work, and I would like to keep it that wayâ€”to an extent.

However, I do realize that open source projects usually flourish with multiple contributors. Thus, I won't say no if you would like to contribute feature work, but please open an issue first so we can discuss it. This way we can avoid unnecessary effort or bikeshedding over architectural or stylistic choices. I have my own opinions and ideas on how certain things should be written in this project.

> I want this project to feel low-barrier, so don't be discouraged from opening an issue, whether it's about existing features, ideas, or anything else!

## What you can do right now

### Found a typo?

Open a PR directly with the correction!

### Found a bug and know how to fix it?

Open a PR with the fix!

### Found a bug but not sure how to fix it or don't want to do it yourself?

Open an issue with steps to reproduce!

### Want to contribute a feature?

Open an issue first so we can chat about the feature work or claim an existing issue for yourself!

## How to make your contribution

1. Fork the `basalt` repository
2. Create a branch
3. Open a pull request against basalt's main branch with your changes
4. I'll review your pull request as soon as possible and either leave comments or merge it

If you find mistakes in the documentation or need simple code fixes, please go ahead and open a pull request with the changes!

### Git Pre-push Hook

There's a useful pre-push git hook under `scripts`, which you can enable by running the following command:

```sh
cp scripts/pre-push .git/hooks/
```

The script runs the same test commands as in the `test.yml` workflow.

## CI

> [!CAUTION]
>
> This section is unfinished. It should explain roughly what is being run in the CI and what is required for CI to actually run on a PR opened from a fork.

_I will create proper contribution guidelines later, with more details on certain operational aspects of this project._
